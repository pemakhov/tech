  'I am a junior front end / back end web developer.',
  'Finding out how the modern websites work and ability to build the whole thing were extremely interesting for me. Therefore I refrained from specializing on the front end or back end yet, but preferred to try out both.',
  'At the moment, I don\'t have an opportunity to develop on the fulltime basis, but I try to always be involved into some kind of project to keep theoretical knowledge and get useful skills. Every day I spend several hours writing the code.',
