#### What I Love
Since 2009 when Node.js emerged, developers received the great opportunity to use JavaScript both on the front and back. ES6 added a lot of helpful features to this language. A few years later, there appeared stunning front-end frameworks and libraries, like React. Eventually, omitting TypeScript in this topic would be a mistake. This language is gaining in popularity every year. Having the syntax familiar to every JavaScript developer, TypeScript permits to write more predictable and reliable code.

The fact that JavaScript is suitable for many platforms and use-cases is not the only reason why I appreciate it. Another cool feature is its multi-paradigm design. First, I considered OOP as the top of the line. Now, my preferences switched to functional programming. And I find it fascinating, that JS suits both paradigms.

#### What I Can
Considering the above, I chose the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack of technologies. I appreciate the opportunity to improve the core of knowledge with minimum effort, which gives me the use of the same language. Therefore, I could get into different aspects of development, such as back-end, front-end, and mobile.

#### My Previous Professional Career
A mechanical design engineer was my first profession. I started with the design of the electronic devices for the nuclear power plant safety systems. Then I switched to the development of LED lights. My primary duties were the next:

+ creating 3D models
+ strength simulation
+ heat transfer simulation
+ drawing and specification creating
+ manufacture support

After promoting to a Team Lead, I became responsible for:

+ teamwork organization
+ junior engineers teaching
+ product idea generating

...and many other things.

I'm convinced that my previous career gave me a lot of skills and knowledge important for web and mobile developer:

- a strong understanding of product design principles: products must be technological, maintainable, time and money efficient, competitive, etc.
- knowing of mass product design principles; tiny improvement in efficiency may get huge profit on the big scale; the product design should ensure scalability; the price of some mistakes is crucial; etc.
- I think I'm a good team player: I understand my responsibilities and try to have nothing to be reproached for; I like when my work is structured and well organized and do it willingly; I collaborate easily; I respect hierarchy; I am always happy to share my knowledge with others.

#### Switching to Programming
In 2019, I started learning computer science, adapted Stanford University Computer Science course at [School++](https://programming.org.ua/en). Since that moment, I've never turned off the road of mastering programming. After Computer Science, there were the "Introduction to Fullstack" course, online courses, three internships in the lead web development company in my city.

Since I acquired some knowledge, I understood that it is essential to practice as much as possible. My first project was a telegram bot for the design bureau where I worked. I created API, providing phone book, birthdays book, and some fun functionality. When it turned out that the API needs an admin panel, I learned React. Learning React Native was the next natural step. Scroll down to check out my experience.
